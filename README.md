## Event Description

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Alpha Bio Cell and Society for Biological Engineering, one bio entrepreneurship based and one biology-based  club in Vellore Institute of Technology came together to
to conduct one-of-a-kind digital expedition - <b>Epistemi</b>, a two-day bio-entrepreneurial event. We plan to encourage
young blooming minds to explore the fields of Entrepreneurship and Biology and how both of them work
hand in hand. Participants will take part in a 36 hour-long intellectual journey to rack their minds to come
up with groundbreaking solutions to real-world problems.</p>

<p>
The journey branches into two parts: - <br>
<b>I. Paradigm:</b> Participants will be joined by renowned speakers from various fields pertaining to our
objective, followed by the release of problem statements. <br>

<b>II. Polemos:</b> Participants will present their solutions to their respective problem statements and pitch
the idea to our esteemed panel of judges.
